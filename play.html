<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>Oh, tendin' to business.</p>

<h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>Tendin' to _other_ folks' business, eh?</p>

<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>[_With a touch of weariness._]</p> <p>Ye-es; reckon that _is_ my
business. Some other folks is me.</p>

<h3>JOEL.</h3> <p>[_Grimacing to_ ELLEN.]</p> <p>Cracked!</p>

<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>[_To_ ANDREW.]</p> <p>You're a mite back'ard in wages, ain't ye?</p>

<h3>ANDREW.</h3> <p>Nine months. What of that?</p>

<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>That's what I dropped round for. Seems like when a man's

<h3>ANDREW.</h3> <p>My pay! You?</p>

<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>Yes; I'm the paymaster.</p>

<h3>THE FIGURE.</h3> <p>[_Bows with a grave, old-fashioned stateliness._]</p> <p>Your
sarvent, ma'am!</p>

<h3>ANDREW.</h3> <p>[_Speaking low._]</p> <p>Keep back, Nell. <p>[_To_ THE FIGURE.]</p> <p>You--you
were saying----</p>
